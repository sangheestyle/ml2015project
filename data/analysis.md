# Analysis for given data set

## Description from Kaggle
For our convenience, I just copy the description of data from [Kaggle](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/when-they-buzz2/data). Enjoy the following description!

**BEGIN:COPY**

This page shows up underneath the data files. Here you describe what files you have provided and the format of each. There is no single format for this page that is appropriate for all competitons, but you should strive to describe as much as you can here. A little time spent describing the data here can save a lot of time answering questions later.

Participants should be able to answer questions like these after reading the data description: What files do I need? What should I expect the data format to be? What am I predicting? What acroynms will I encounter?

### File descriptions
* train.csv - the training set
