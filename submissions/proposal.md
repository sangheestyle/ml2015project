# Machine Learning (Spring 2015) Final Project Proposal

## Team
* **Member**: Sanghee Kim, Hui Soon Kim, Choong-Wan Woo
* **Project**: Default project
* **Purpose**: In this project, we will predict when users answer the questions based on features of questions and answering history of users.
* **Repository**: https://github.com/sangheestyle/ml2015project

## Techniques we will explore
### Feature engineering
* We will use natural language processing techniques (e.g., vectorization, stemming and lemmatization, etc.) to convert the questions into meaningful features. 
* We will explore the possibility of using the characteristics of questions (e.g., the level of difficulty) and usersâ€™ answering history as features. 
Interactions among users and questions might be important (e.g., different users could have specialties in different topic areas). Thus, we will think about a way to include the interaction in our features. 

### Building and evaluating prediction algorithms
Whether the outcome variable is continuous or categorical is unclear to us. We will first compare the performance of machine learning algorithms for continuous (e.g., regression) and categorical (e.g., naive bayes, SVM) outcome variables. Based on the results, we will elaborate our algorithms using error analysis and cross-validation approach. 

## Timeline
We have 4 iterations for this project.

### Iteration 1 - 4/08/2015
* Making simple working implementation for feature engineering, prediction model with a regularized regression, and generating results for understanding setup. (Baseline for this project)
* Using question length, player identity, and question id at first.
* Turning in the first submission into Kaggle.

### Iteration 2 - 4/20/2015
* Improving feature engineering and model. (especially feature engineering) 
* Improving performance by conducting error analysis through cross validation.
* Writing up experimental reports in ipython notebook for proof and retrospection.
* Turning in submissions on a daily basis.

### Iteration 3 - 4/29/2015
* Improving model.
* Refactoring code to make it easy to understand and to explain. Specifically, make the implementation with input variables.
* Writing experimental reports in ipython notebook for proof and retrospection.
* Turning in submissions on a daily basis.

### Iteration 4 - 5/04/2015
* Improving model.
* Writing experimental reports in ipython notebook for proof and retrospection.
* Turning in submissions on a daily basis.
* Writing final report.

### Final Presentations: 5/6/15
### Final submission: 5/7/15 (23:55)
* Truning in the final report. (By Choong-Wan Woo)

## Output
* Github repository for implementation.
* Experimental reports.
* Final reports.
